# Flight Optimization System

## Overview
This is a professional-level project demonstrating concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. 
The project aims to optimize flight routes based on user preferences like time, cost, and distance. 
It employs advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford, with real-time visualization.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains all the source code files.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files.
- `data/`: Contains sample data files (e.g., JSON or CSV for nodes and routes).
- `visualization/`: Scripts or libraries for visualization of flight routes.
- `tests/`: Test cases for the project.

## Features
- Finds optimized flight routes based on user preferences.
- Supports dynamic graph updates (add/remove routes and airports).
- Visualization of routes using a graphical interface.
- Implements algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford for pathfinding.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Run `main.cpp` to start the system.
